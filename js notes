
//Important to Know: 
//Our game will run inside of Update Loop so every frame that passes will call a function that updates the position and logic of our game
//We will create seperate classes so they are easier to work with 

//1. Create a Ball Js that the ball will pass through 
//2. Import Ball js to Script Js
//3. Add a time function to calculate how much time has passed since the start of the game  and call it 
    //note of caution do not use setInterval here beacuse it may not be accurate
    //convert time to delta
    //check for lastTime null statement in the beginning of programming (because there will be no last time) - add if else
//4. Update our Ball js
    //create a helper function to get position, direction and velocity
    //we also need a function for randomNumberBetween or console will flag this as an error when testing our direction and velocity 
    //a function to allow ball to bounce from the top and bottom of the screen 
//5. Add Paddle JS
    //No update function is needed for Player beacuse the y axis is the same as the mouse movement 
    //Add an eventListener instead here (in script.js)
    //Use a getter and setter in Paddle.js for our position 
    //FOR THE COMPUTER YOU NEED TO USE THE UPDATE FUNCTION 
//6. add lose code to handle player lose, reset and if player scores or computer scores
//7. Figure out way to fix the code so the ball bounces of the paddle in Ball js
