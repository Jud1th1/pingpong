
//Important to Know: 
//Our game will run inside of Update Loop so every frame that passes will call a function that updates the position and logic of our game
//We will create seperate classes so they are easier to work with 

//1. Create a Ball Js that the ball will pass through 
//2. Import Ball js to Script Js
//3. Add a time function to calculate how much time has passed since the start of the game  and call it 
    //note of caution do not use setInterval here beacuse it may not be accurate
    //convert time to delta
    //check for lastTime null statement in the beginning of programming (because there will be no last time) - add if else
//4. Update our Ball js
    //create a helper function to get position, direction and velocity
    //we also need a function for randomNumberBetween or console will flag this as an error when testing our direction and velocity 
    //a function to allow ball to bounce from the top and bottom of the screen 
//5. Add Paddle JS
    //No update function is needed for Player beacuse the y axis is the same as the mouse movement 
    //Add an eventListener instead here (in script.js)
    //Use a getter and setter in Paddle.js for our position 
    //FOR THE COMPUTER YOU NEED TO USE THE UPDATE FUNCTION 
//6. add lose code to handle player lose, reset and if player scores or computer scores
//7. Figure out way to fix the code so the ball bounces of the paddle in Ball js 


/*Attempting to take it step further I want to 
    a way for the game to end after the player or the
    computer reaches 11points and I want to add an alert 
    to signal to the player that they lose or won*/

//8. Modify handleLose function to check if either player has reached score of 11
function handleLose() {
  const rect = ball.rect()
  if (rect.right >= window.innerWidth) {
    playerScoreElem.textContent = parseInt(playerScoreElem.textContent) + 1 //player has scored
    if (parseInt(playerScoreElem.textContent) === 11) {
      showGameOverMessage("You won!")
      return
    }
  } else {
    computerScoreElem.textContent = parseInt(computerScoreElem.textContent) + 1 //computer has scored
    if (parseInt(computerScoreElem.textContent) === 11) {
      showGameOverMessage("You lost!")
      return
    }
  }
  ball.reset()
  computerPaddle.reset()
}

//Add a new function showGameOverMessage() to show the pop-up message:
javascript
Copy code
function showGameOverMessage(message) {
  const gameOverMessageElem = document.createElement("div")
  gameOverMessageElem.className = "game-over-message"
  gameOverMessageElem.textContent = message
  const restartButton = document.createElement("button")
  restartButton.textContent = "Restart"
  restartButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
    gameOverMessageElem.remove()
    playerScoreElem.textContent = "0"
    computerScoreElem.textContent = "0"
    lastTime = null
    window.requestAnimationFrame(update)
  })
  gameOverMessageElem.appendChild(restartButton)
  document.body.appendChild(gameOverMessageElem)
}

//Remove the event listener for the player paddle movement once the game is over:
javascript
Copy code
function showGameOverMessage(message) {
  // ...
  document.body.appendChild(gameOverMessageElem)
  document.removeEventListener("mousemove", onPlayerPaddleMouseMove)
}

function onPlayerPaddleMouseMove(e) {
  playerPaddle.position = (e.y / window.innerHeight) * 100
}
document.addEventListener("mousemove", onPlayerPaddleMouseMove)


//Bugs- The pop up is there but the game will no longer play or if it plays the player wins in less than 2 seconds. :(
